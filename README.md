# Designing a cross-reactivity testing tool for diagnostic kit primers
In this study, with having databases of all kinds of genomes, we want to check the available primers and see if there is a complementary relationship with the genomes in the database. As a project, our primer must be specific and if it sticks to another existing gene, cross reactivity will occur and we will check this cross reactivity in silico.
